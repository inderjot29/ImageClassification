Requirement -> NeuralNetwork.py, FeatureTuning.py and the data files should be in the same folder.
Usage -> To use Feed forward neural networks, run the following command on terminal:

python NeuralNetwork.py [filename with images, X] [filename with class labels, Y]

It will ask if you want to balance the dataset  and perform data augmentation, input y -> yes and n ->no.

Assumption for data augmentation- assumes the data set to be sorted numerically i.e. depending upon the class labels.
